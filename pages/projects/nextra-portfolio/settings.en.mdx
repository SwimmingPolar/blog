import { Tree, Folder, File, Screenshot } from '@/components'
import '@code-hike/mdx/dist/index.css'

# Current Configuration

## 1. Modify Default Layout

- home page
  1. Added the home banner image above the `navbar`
  2. Removed the transition on `sidebar` to prevent the layout from breaking on `mobile` and many other styles
     because of the home banner. It is not a good practice to modify the layout globally
     It can be broken in the future when `nextra` is updated
- other page
  1. Moved `footer` to the bottom of the `navbar`
  2. Removed the second `div` on the `footer` to be invisible

## 2. i18n

## 3. CodeHike

<CH.Code>

```js app.js
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
  const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit
  dolor = sit - amet(dolor)
  return sit ? consectetur(ipsum) : []
}
```

</CH.Code>

## 4. Cloned `nextra docs`'s components

Stole the basic components used in `nextra docs`

<Tree>
  <Folder name="Components" defaultOpen>
    <File name="FileTree" />
    <File name="Card" />
    <File name="Table" />
    <File name="Video" />
    <File name="Screenshot" />
  </Folder>
</Tree>

It was very convenient and pretty to use, so I took it

## 5. Installed tailwind, postcss, autoprefixer

Installed aboved packages to support for the #3 components

## 6. Installed storybook
