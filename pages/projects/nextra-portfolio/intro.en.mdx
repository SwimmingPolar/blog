# Nextra Review

## 1. Learning Curve

    {" "}

When creating a blog, we need to use a template or create one
from scratch by ourselves. I could have built it from scratch
but it's difficult to just add basic features we need on a blog,
so I chose to use a template. I've seen people using 'Notion' or
github page with 'Jekyll', for me, 'Notion' looks exceptionally
complicated. At first glance, it seems to be just attaching components.
But in detail, there are many variables to control like building some
kind of design system. For `Jekyll`, I don't know why, but I feel like
it's missing something. `nextra` gives me a feeling that it is a well-made
cooking pack that still works even if I add my own ingredients but is just
fine without any.

<Tree>
  <Folder name="Features" defaultOpen>
    <File name="Markdown" />
    <File name="Code Highlight" />
    <File name="Image Optimization" />
    <File name="Deploy" />
    <File name="SSG / SSR" />
    <File name="SEO" />
  </Folder>
</Tree>

It does not provide too many features, and appropriately removes
unnecessary things so that web developers can easily build a site.
To install a code highlighting library like CodeHike, MDX2 is required,
but since MDX2 is supported by default, there is no need to install and
set it up separately. Plug-ins or libraries that require MDX can be
installed and used immediately.

<CH.Code>

```js app.js focus=2:4
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
  const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit;
  dolor = sit - amet(dolor);
  return sit ? consectetur(ipsum) : [];
}
```

```python hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

---

```css styles.css
.lorem {
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px;
  background: #000;
}
```

</CH.Code>

## 2. Degree of Completion

    {" "}

At this point, there is no various `theme` provided, so you have to configure
it from the beginning. I've visited a lot of `Jekyll` demo sites to choose a
theme for my own blog, but it's just hard to find the one I want. On the other
hand `nextra` offer `navbar`, `sidebar`, `footer`, and even searchbar` to play
around with and use as you like. The degree of completion is high enough that
you can use it as it is if you do not need customization. The design is neat
enough not to get boring, but it doesn't fall behind modern web design.

Although it is very simple to create routing or menus based on routing, it
is a little annoying. `nextra` uses `next.js`, so if you create a file
in `pages` folder, a link is automatically created in `navbar` component provided
by `nextra`. To rename or reorder links in `navbar`, you only need to
edit `_meta.json` file recognized by `nextra`.

After completing the basic settings, I just had to create an `mdx` file
in the `page` folder and start writing. Since `next.js` is what's behind the `nextra`,
`i18n` or 'dark mode' configuration is easy and it is easy to respond to the language respectively.

#### \_meta.json Configuration

import MetaJsonScreenshot from "../../../public/pages/projects/nextra-portfolio/_meta.json.png";

<Screenshot src={MetaJsonScreenshot} alt="_meta.json.screenshot" />

<br />

<CH.Code>
```json _meta.en.json
{
  "*": {
    "type": "page"
  },
  "index": {
    "title": "Summary"
  },
  "projects": {
    "title": "Projects"
  },
  "stacks": {
    "title": "Stacks"
  },
  "contact": {
    "title": "Contact"
  }
}
```

```json _meta.ko.json
{
  "*": {
    "type": "page"
  },
  "index": {
    "title": "요약"
  },
  "projects": {
    "title": "프로젝트"
  },
  "stacks": {
    "title": "기술 스택"
  },
  "contact": {
    "title": "연락처"
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

#### \_meta.json Configuration Result

import NavbarScreenshot from "../../../public/pages/projects/nextra-portfolio/navbar.png";

<Screenshot src={NavbarScreenshot} alt="navbar.screenshot" />

The added page appears in the `navbar` component without any extra
configurations, and the order and name set in `_meta.json` are mapped to the
page file name.

## 3. Pros and Cons

### Pros

The advantages will be the ones mentioned above, and, To be honest,
I'm in no position to comment on this because I haven't used other
blog templates or libraries. Still, if I had to point out the advantages
felt while using `nextra`, except for the features mentioned above,
Hmm... not really. However, I think the biggest advantage is that there
is no discomfort like I felt when using 'Notion' because of its vast
features and the overwhelming number of components and emojis. And a
feeling that I had when trying to use 'Jekyll' that something was missing out.

I don't know why, but the folders that I unknowingly overlapped to make
the layout cleaner on `notion`, or all the wandering that I had to go
through to look for more perfect skin when I decided to use 'Jekyll'.
It's all gone.

> Install > Default Configuration > Deploy > Write MDX File

### Cons

#### Customizing

Since it is a framework, there are many abstractions.
The pros of `nextra` because it's based on `next.js` can be a disadvantage.
It can be easier to use `nextra` if you take a look at `next.js`'s tutorial first before
using `nextra`.

The biggest drawback is that you need to know `next.js` to make it easier
to use `nextra`, and since there are many abstractions when
you want to take it out and customize it, you will find yourself wondering
where should I modify it.
It is convenient that `navbar` is provided, but we don't have complete access to other
default components like `footer` or `sidebar` when styling. So I had to force customization through
globals.css instead of through the functions provided by `nextra`,
then later when `nextra` gets updated, this whole force customization can easily turn into a useless configuration.

#### Official Documentation

It's still in the early stages of project, so it's not well documented.
`nextra` has two basic `themes`. There are `doc` and `blog`, but currently
only the documentation for `doc` is provided, and this is not perfect either.
The activity of the project maintainer itself is active, so it doesn't seem
to be a big problem.
