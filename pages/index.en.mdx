# Perspective

I'm interested in dynamic over static. I think about ideas and
methods to provide optimized UI/UX. I prefer clarity to fogginess.
I like to think in terms of gaps in reality when coming up with ideas.
As I work on projects, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve, and
when I introduce new technologies, I don't just use them, I think about
what I can learn from them and how I can apply them to future development.
I think I'm a pretty slow learner because of this, but I think the more
time I put into it, the better the outcome.
