# Perspective

I have a mindset of thinking towards how I can offer the
best UI/UX over just a static website. I prefer to stay
away from vague ideas. I often take more time than I would
usually do when composing or brainstorming about a project
or a plan. When the time comes where I can't only do what
I like the most, I try to get the most out of it and learn
what's new and how I can utilize the moment. Such ideas
sometimes make me look like a slow learner. To be honest,
I am. But I believe it's not always bad to take time and be thorough.
